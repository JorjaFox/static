    <h3>A History of Hate</h3>
<p>After eighteen years on the web, there are few things I hang on to when it comes to abuse, but Twitter, and it's lack of willingness to protect anyone, gets special treatment.</p>

<p>Jorja is on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/jorjafoxofficia">@jorjafoxofficia</a></p>  </div>

        <p>I have absolutely no idea what started this, to be honest. The account has been dormant since 2010, however the location (South Africa) was the source of a lot of hate mail and comments on JFO for another year. The whole mess started after I was invited to meet Jorja at the Chicago HSUS Gala.</p>

        <p>This was the first set (read from the bottom up, sorry). Neither JAA nor JFO had even so much as spoken to this person at this point:</p>
        
        <p><img src="1.png" /></p>
        
        <p>Now I should note that I had pointed out a couple of fake accounts, but I try not to include their @ symbols so they don't get notified. Why? Because of that sort of behavior. Suddenly, however, I was the target.</p>

        <p><img src="2.png" /></p>

        <p>My guess there is I'd said "I've met Jorja and she knows how to get in touch with me." And it's true. Both her assistant back then and her current one have my cell phone number, and they have my email.</p>
        
        <p><img src="3.png" /></p>
        
        <p>To help let the fake Jorja verify herself, I followed her and asked her to provide the last four digits of her assistants cell number. She said "Fuck you." And then I was accused of Photoshopping.</p>
        
        <p><img src="4.png" /></p>

        <p>And finaly here is my <em>ONLY</em> reply to this person.</p>
