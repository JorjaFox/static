    <h3>A History of Hate</h3>
<p>After eighteen years on the web, there are few things I hang on to when it comes to abuse, but Twitter, and it's lack of willingness to protect anyone, gets special treatment.</p>

<p>Jorja is on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/jorjafoxofficia">@jorjafoxofficia</a></p>  </div>

        <p>There isn't a lot of this one I can share, for various reasons. What I can say is this became the basis for my second restraining order ever. The first goes to the guy who <em>called my house</em>.</p>
        
        <p>The short story is this. @_jorjafox_ showed up claiming to be Jorja. Bad timing, as I'd met Jorja that year, so I pinged the account and said "Hey, if it's you, have your assistant contact me and I'll verify you." That did not happen (because it wasn't Jorja) and I said this:</p>
        
        <p><img src="notjorja.png" /></p>
        
        <p>Time went by and I was asked by the new '@jorjafox' account to please verify her, because it was her. I asked for proof and was rebuffed. As I recall I asked for her assistant's phone number, but to be fair <em>only</em> the last four digits.</p>
        
        <p><img src="phone.png" /></p>

        <p>Eventually someone else asked me if she was real and I said no. Which got a complaint and a please verify again request. This conversation looks odd because her account was deleted and I didn't find the old copy I had:</p>
                
        <p><img src="callme.png" /></p>
        <p><img src="not-verify.png" /></p>
        
        <p>Which devolved into a complaint:</p>
        
        <p><img src="fake-jorja-stalk.jpg" /></p>
        
        <p>I was a little mean at that point, but she'd been asking me to verify her.</p>
        
        <p><img src="not-stalk.png" /></p>
        
        <p><img src="still-no.png" /></p>
        
        <p>So I contacted her assistant, explained what was going on and how to file a complaint to Twitter. And guess what? It worked!</p>
