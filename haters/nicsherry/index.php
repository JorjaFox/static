    <h3>A History of Hate</h3>
<p>After eighteen years on the web, there are few things I hang on to when it comes to abuse, but Twitter, and it's lack of willingness to protect anyone, gets special treatment.</p>

<p>Jorja is on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/jorjafoxofficia">@jorjafoxofficia</a></p>  </div>

        <p>This account was suspended by Twitter for reasons I do not know. I only have interest in shutting down fake accounts when they're harmful, and the NicSherri/NicSherry ones were outright abusive.</p>
    
        <p>This is a long story....</p>
        
        <p>Nicolette Sheridan wasn't (and still isn’t on Twitter). But there were no less than four fake accounts pretending to be her in November 2010. And I seem to have ended up ‘taking her on’ as my @jorjafoxonline account after telling her I thought she was fake, and saying I’d only apologize IF and WHEN she posted a picture of herself with her Twitter Handle.</p>

        <p>At a certain point, I stopped talking to her, though I didn’t block her since really, she amused me, and didn’t spam me too much. But then I made the mistake of talking to a fellow fan account.</p>

        <p><img src="1-crackpot.png" /></p>
        
        <p>And thus I brought it on myself:</p>
        
        <p><img src="2-crackpot.png" /></p>
        
        <p>I’m not sure where she thought I was sending her with a link to http://support.twitter.com personally. I mean… it’s a link TO TWITTER. I felt I was being pretty upfront (and I kind of wanted to see what Twitter would do with it). It went downhill from there:</p>
        
        <p><img src="3-crackpot.png" /></p>
        
        <p>At this point, you can see where I stop replying, which is because I blocked her and walked away. I did keep tabs on her, since I think it’s best to know where your adversaries are hiding. That’s how I knew she said this:</p>
        
        <p><img src="nicsheri-delete.jpg" /></p>
        
        <p>JOF. Jorja Obsessed Fan. I’m not obsessed with Jorja, but I’ve long since given up with arguing people about that. I mean, either you believe that I’m just a normal fan with some cool skills for webstuff and the Internet, or I’m a freakyass stalker. Up to you. By the way, I don’t delete tweets unless they’ve got some egregious typos or bad links. I also got these gems:</p>
        
        <p><img src="nicsheri-jof.jpg" /></p>
        
        <p>Finally, on Halloween, @NicSheri posted a clearly photoshopped picture of ‘herself’ holding up a sign proving she was really Nicolette. I found out when one of my friends passed me a link to Formspring, and then moments later I got this:</p>
        
        <p><img src="nicsheri-twitter.png" /></p>
        
        <p>http://twitpic.com/32pr6p is gone, but ... well here's the proof:</p>
        
        <p><img src="proof.png" /></p>
        
        <p>I don’t claim to be a Nicolette fan (I know who she is, which is more than I can say of many actors on shows I don’t watch), but even I could see that was faked. I passed on the image link to some people who know better, and they sorted out that it was a screencap of a Desperate Housewives episode. How tragic. People start to bitch that it’s a fake, and she screams ‘I’ve been hacked!’ The image is deleted, many ‘fake’ Formspring replies are deleted (though not that one…) and she accused many people (though not me!) of hacking her.</p>
        
        <p>After all that, we fansites managed to get Nicolette Sheridan's legal team to shut down the accounts. Thus her accounts were deleted and she made a new one, calling me out:</p>
        
        <p><img src="nicsherry.png" /></p>
        
        <p>Of course... that ended up deleted too! I had nothing to do with that! In fact I said I was glad she was a real fan account now.</p>
