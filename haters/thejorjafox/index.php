    <h3>A History of Hate</h3>
<p>After eighteen years on the web, there are few things I hang on to when it comes to abuse, but Twitter, and it's lack of willingness to protect anyone, gets special treatment.</p>

<p>Jorja is on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/jorjafoxofficia">@jorjafoxofficia</a></p>  </div>

  <article>
    <div class="headline-wrap">
      <h1>thejorjafox</h1>
      <h2></h2>
    </div><!--/ .headline-wrap -->
    <div class="article-wrap">
        <p>My tweets from this period are missing (I even downloading my own archive from Twitter, and there's 8 months just not around) so my replies to this account are vanished. I reported this account to Twitter (who said "You don't work for Ms. Fox" only not so nicely) and Jorja's then assistant.</p>
        
        <p>This first tweet was a reply to me where I said I suspected the account as being fake since it linked to Jorjafox.net (still does) and not her own two sites which were up back then.</p>
      
        <p><img src="1.png" /></p>
        
        <p>Then I pointed out she wasn't verified.</p>
        
        <p><img src="2.png" /></p>
        
        <p>And the official SITES! (.org and .com which are hers) were fakes!</p>
        
        <p><img src="3.png" /></p>

        <p>I think I said "Funny cause the ISP information is yours." I implied that the emails I'd gotten from her were from those accounts. They weren't FWIW. This is one of my slight lies to catch them in.</p>
        
        <p><img src="5.png" /></p>
        
        <p>And now they're not really her sites, they're made and managed for her. Which I believe, except if you remember the old site, it was totes Jorja.</p>

        <p><img src="6.png" /></p>
        
        <p>At this point I DID contact her agency to file a report about it, and they said thank you, and I said if she could verify that would help, or have her assistant ping me.</p>

        <p><img src="7.png" /></p>

        <p>And it never happened.</p>
